# Difference b/w Factory Method and Abstract factory.
Factory Method: A factory that creates objects that derive from a particular base class.
Abstract factory: A factory that creates other factories, and these factories in turn create objects derived from base classes. You do this because you often don't just want to create a single object (as with Factory method) - rather, you want to create a collection of related objects.
